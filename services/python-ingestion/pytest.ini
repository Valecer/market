# Warning filters
# Suppress ResourceWarnings for unclosed SQLite connections in unit tests
# These are non-critical - SQLite connections are cleaned up by Python's GC
# The db_session fixture properly disposes of the engine, but some internal
# SQLAlchemy operations may create temporary connections that trigger warnings
# Python 3.13 is stricter about connection cleanup, but these warnings don't
# affect test functionality since connections are in-memory and cleaned up on GC
